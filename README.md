# Mission_to_Mars

## Objective and Purpose
Update Robin’s web app to add 4 images of Mars’s hemispheres. First adjust the current web app to include all four hemisphere images by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of the hemispheres and titles of the images. Next store the scraped data on a Mongo database and use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate the four images.
